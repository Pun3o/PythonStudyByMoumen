    "The primary goal of this lab is to ensure that your Python installation process went smoothly, and that there are no lingering Python 2/3 bugs floating around.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab also gives you the chance to write what might be your first programs in Python, and allows you to experiment with both scripts and with the interactive interpreter!\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems are not intended to be algorithmically challenging - just ways to flex your new Python 3 muscles. Even if the problems seem simple, work through them quickly, and then you're free to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "As always, have fun, and enjoy the (remainder of the) class period!\n",
